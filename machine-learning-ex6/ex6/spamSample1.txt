ve a lot of questions about the Republicans’ new health care bill, but one thing is for sure: It’s the worst.

It hurts middle-class families, women, and older Americans. No one wins except billionaires.

It also brings Paul Ryan one step closer to his goal of destroying Medicare by destabilizing it. It also forces Americans ages 50-64 to pay up to FIVE times more than younger enrollees for insurance.

We can’t let them get away with this.

Paul Ryan wants America to turn its back on seniors. Stand up to protect Medicare as we know it.

This program sneakily weakens Medicare. See, the ACA improved Medicare’s finances. It extended the life of Medicare’s trust fund, which helps pay for the program.

Repealing the ACA and replacing it with this plan will drain Medicare’s trust fund four years earlier -- which is fine by Paul Ryan because he can’t wait for an excuse to turn it into a voucher system.

Don’t let it happen. Make sure Ryan, Trump, and the GOP know you will fight to protect Medicare.

Thank you,

Team Pelosi
